# Privacy Policy for DF YouTube

## Introduction

DF YouTube is a browser extension that removes distracting elements from YouTube, allowing you to focus on the content you want to watch without being pulled into endless scrolling or recommendations.

This privacy policy explains what information DF YouTube collects, how it is used, and how it is protected.
